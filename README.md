# CS-230-R3235-Operating-Platforms-Portfolio
Final Project REPO for CS-230-R3235 Operating Platforms

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  
The Gaming Room was a game design studio who asked us to assist in the development of a web port of their mobile app 'Draw it or Lose it!'. They asked us to develop a server-client program to handle various aspects of the game that can be accessed through modern web-browsers.
- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  
I feel I did a particularly good job documenting benefits/disadvantages of various platforms for hosting the server and for client access between Windows, Mac, Linux and mobile devices.
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
I found the UML Diagram to be particularly useful to reference while developing the program application.
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
I would further revise my evaluations and reccomendations as I feel despite the work I put into that section especially, it could've been done better overall to fit the requirements of The Gaming Room more.
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
End-user usability is imperative to design, as if the end product is left unusable to the intended client, then it doesn't matter how much work was put into it or how well it functions if people can't use it.
- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  
I approached designing the software through extensive pre-planning through pseudocode and diagrams, while referencing the provided UML diagram(s) to ensure the software functioned as requested by the client.
